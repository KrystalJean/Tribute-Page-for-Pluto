        <h3 id="headline"><u>Classification of Pluto according to IAU Planet Guidelines.</u></h3>
        <li>The object must orbit around the sun.    <i><small><strong>Yes,</strong> Pluto does orbit around our sun here in the Milky Way galaxy.</small></i></li>
        <li>The object needs sufficient mass to be round, or almost round.   <i><small><strong>Yes,</strong>Pluto meets this qualification, as well.</small></i>
        <li>The object is not a satelite or a moon, which is like a natural satelite.  <i><small><strong>Yes,</strong>checkmark again! Pluto is not considered a moon because it does not orbit another planet.It orbits the same star as us, the Sun.</small></i>
        <li>Finally, the object must have removed any small debris from its path of orbit.   <i><small><strong>No,</strong>    this is what's holding Pluto back from being considered a planet!</small></i>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="conclusion-title"><u>So, then...What happened to the ninth planet?</u></h3>
      <p id="conclusion-summary">...And then there were eight. Pluto is now considered a "dwarf planet". Pluto and it's moons are surrounded by debris in what is called the Kuiper Belt, which according to dictionary.com contains many comets, asteroids, and other small bodies made largely of ice.  Although many people believe this small detail is the deciding factor in the argument of what determines a planet, there are still others who will always defend Pluto as our ninth planet. #plutopancakeplanet</p>
